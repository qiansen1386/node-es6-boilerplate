# NodeJs boilerplate in ES2015

> Usage: Please DO NOT use it. Take it as a reference design and craft your own masterpiece.

Yet another general NodeJs boilerplate in ES2015+.  
For personal use only, licensed under WTFPL(GPL-compatible). 

## Purpose

a. "import" is not supportted by Nodejs right now => Whenever u doubt the future, look for Babel(JS).
b. Snapshot all best practices: [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development),  [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

## Development Environment

Windows 10 64bit 
Git bash / Bash On Windows
VS code + ESLint extension
Nodejs 6.9.1(latest stable)

> NOTE: Register current npm bin folder into PATH before making use of tools like babel/eslint, 
by executing `. npm-register.sh` or `source npm-register.sh` in your shell.
If u are using BashOnWin then edit the `npm-register.sh` first according to instruction.

## Entries

### 1. index
index is the entry of most of RESTful/~~gRPC~~ apis. 

### 2. admin (TBC)
admin.js is a administration Portal. By design, configuration should be done in eitehr config file or GUI.

### 3. ping (TBC)
A service which should perform a series of system integration tests if last result expires.  
For status-checking service(pingdom) / client user to check status of service, or even HA service keeper.

## Configuration references

According to [The Twelve-Factor App - III. Config](https://12factor.net/config), configuration should strictly been separated from code. Because An appâ€™s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys (staging, production, developer environments, etc).

So we put all the settings to environment variables and manage them using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) lib.

> Note: `.env` files should not be committed.

```ini
SERVER_PORT=3000
SERVER_HOST=localhost
SERVER_SECURE_PORT=443
```

## Commands

> See more @ [package.json](./package.json)

* `npm run dev` launch node dev server.
* `. killallnode.sh` kill all running node instances.
